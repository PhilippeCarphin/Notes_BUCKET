*** DONE Heroku info

Basically,
heroku login
heroku create
git push heroku master

https://github.com/datademofun/heroku-basic-flask

A heroku app has a requirements.txt like produced by pip freeze, a runtime.txt
file that says which version of python I want.

A Procfile that contains the line
web: <The command to start run my app>

I changed my run.py in an erratic way because I thought that file's name or
structure was significant to heroku until I found out that it was in the
procfile that I was to specify how to start the program.
