** DONE Deploy Heroku app
   CLOSED: [2018-07-28 Sat 19:36]

*** DONE Heroku info
    CLOSED: [2018-07-14 Sat 02:24]
Basically,
heroku login
heroku create
git push heroku master

https://github.com/datademofun/heroku-basic-flask

A heroku app has a requirements.txt like produced by pip freeze, a runtime.txt
file that says which version of python I want.

A Procfile that contains the line
web: <The command to start run my app>

I changed my run.py in an erratic way because I thought that file's name or
structure was significant to heroku until I found out that it was in the
procfile that I was to specify how to start the program.

** DONE Look into atom org-mode (for Mom)
   CLOSED: [2018-07-22 Sun 12:28]
https://atom.io/packages/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=keyword:org-mode It's all
garbage. Sublime, VScode, Atom. They all do some little thing like coloring
text, but they all fold based on indentation. The whole point is to fold based
on headings. That's the whole thing about defining hierarchical structures, it
has to be based on headings. The best way will be setting up emacs in a
minimalist way. All I want is org-mode's folding based on headings.
