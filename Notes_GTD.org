#+TITLE: Notes about getting things done

* Ramblings

When you empty your in tray, you clarify a thing into a project.  You file it in
the "current projects" of your project list.  This works because you know that
this project will consistently receive your attention, therefore you can get it
off your mind now.

Putting "Learn guitar" in my "less current projects" works because every week I'll give
it a tiny bit of attention.  I might decide to move it to another category so
that I see it less often.

Pre GTD, if I have an idea about cool function to make myself in org-mode, if it's a good
idea I don't want to lose it.  If it's going to take 10 minutes, do I really
want to file it in a system somewhere etc... no, so the only way to not lose the
idea is to do it right now, and by the task ends up taking more than 10 minutes.
By the time it's done I have another idea that won't take long that I don't want
to lose.

With GTD, I capture all that stuff and don't interrupt my work.  Later, I empty
my in tray and maybe I do it then or file it in a "Improve org-mode" or "improve
Emacs" project.

** GTD-REFERENCE GTD definition of planning
   CLOSED: [2018-09-14 Fri 20:27]
   - CLOSING NOTE [2018-09-14 Fri 20:27] \\
     this is reference material
The definition of planning is different with GTD than one might think.  Planning
is more about laying out the actions that need to be taken complete a project.
This is not about diciding when to do what.
** GTD-REFERENCE Add a vision part to my org-gtd spec

Implement all the GTD practices in a way that respects the principles.

*** Not automating certain things

**** The review process
One might be tempted to eliminate the need for reviewing by using all sorts of features of org-mode.

The review process is central to attaining a clear mind.

**** The In Tray

With quick commands and capture templates it can be tempting to get rid of the in tray all together.

Because the review process is so important, the quality of the organized material must be high.

Having the opportunity to bypass the in tray for stuff that is already clear. 


*** GTD-IN Main intention of my org-mode implementation of GTD

Not automate things that should not be automated but accelerate them.  Like the weekly and daily reviews and the processing of items from In.

You can’t get rid of the review by automation.  The review is the only means to attain a clear mind.

Processing of it items must not be rushed lest it diminish the quality of the content and make the review process more difficult.

The power of GTD is in NOT automating certain things. 

* Implementation of GTD in org-mode

** GTD objects

A GTD object is implemented as headline with todo-keyword beginning with ~GTD-~
followed by the name of a GTD object.

*** GTD-IN
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID:       92459C26-9E22-4FCA-9974-7FE9E15885A5
    :END:

This is something that has not been processed.  It will become one of the other
objects when *processing your in tray*

*** GTD-CLARIFY
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID:       CCDF288A-6A97-4295-81F7-48509F531FFE
    :END:

A kind of state between GTD-IN and GTD-ACTION.  It allows me to move something
into an action list without having fully clarified it.  It's an "Almost action".

*** GTD-ACTION
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID:       D7709FF1-EC0A-47D0-9C1F-9A3736B11657
    :END:

This represents an action in the sense of GTD.  They can be standalone actions
or be part of a project.  An action cannot have sub-actions otherwise it would
be a project.

*** GTD-NEXT-ACTION
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID:       35862C4E-7859-4B79-A49A-666F504CF552
    :END:

This is the same kind of object as an action but this marks the action as the
next action of a project.  This may not seem important but it is.

*** GTD-WAITING
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID:       63D86EEC-C61C-452A-B373-EF4596100444
    :END:
An action that cannot proceed because I'm waiting on somebody else.  This is
different from actions of a project that are not the next action.  Or it can be
for a task that has been delegated but needs to be monitored actively.
*** GTD-PROJECT
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID:       8D8E786A-3825-4101-82CE-CF487011B1DC
    :END:

In GTD, a project is a desired outcome that requires more than one action, and
for which we find the next action.

In org-gtd, a project has an :OUTCOME: drawer and action children, one of which
is of type GTD-NEXT-ACTION.  It is recommended to have only one next action
although I have found it useful to have more than one.

Projects can have sub projects.  David Allen comments on sub projects in his
book.

*** GTD-SOMEDAY-MAYBE
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID:       8F14A2C0-4D5B-43C0-8FE0-FFFEDD283A09
    :END:

Same kind of thing as a project but explicitely marked as something different.
In the "mind like water" philosophy, it might be better to mark something as
someday maybe and leave it in the project list.

*** GTD-DELEGATED
This is similar to GTD-WAITING but indicates a lower need for my attention.  I
can't mark it complete but it doesn't need anything (or much) from me.
*** GTD-DONE

This is for a completed action or next action or project.  I also use reference
for completed objects.  The difference being that GTD-DONE means the thing is
completed and I'll probably put this in some archive.  On the other hand
GTD-REFERENCE will indicate a completed task that has some reference material
like the task might have been to send an e-mail and I want to keep a record of
when I sent the e-mail with the project.

*** GTD-REFERENCE

This marks a headline as *non-actionnable*.  This is important to accelerate the
review process.  All the GTD lists exept for "in" and "reference" are strictly
for actionnable items.  If anything is non-actionnable and wants to get in there
it's going to have to have this badge.

*** Other todo keywords

I kept the regular todo keywords because I want TODOs that are not part of GTD.
Like TODOs in code and TODOs in my notes.  I want the GTD todos to stand out.

Also, I want to be able to use non-GTD todos in GTD.  For example, a single
action might be more than one steps.  I want to plan the execution of the action
while keeping obvious the fact that it is one action.

** GTD files
*** ~GTD_InTray.org~

The in tray where inputs from the world go to be processed.  All my GTD-INs are
level 2 headlines in the single level 1 headline "GTD Input Tray".  Org-capture
is setup to dump things there too.

*** ~GTD_NextActions.org~

This is where actions go. All actions are level 2 headlines allowing the use of
level 1 headlines for making ad-hoc categories of actions.  I haven't settled on
any categories.

*NOTE* I deviate a bit from GTD here.  Normally, you're supposed to have all
your actions and *all* the next actions from your projects in this list.

Because of org-mode, it is better to get a sparse tree of GTD-NEXT-ACTIONS if
you want a list of all your next actions.

I just copy-paste the headline from a select list of GTD-NEXT-ACTIONS to put
under a /Project Next Actions/ headline of ~GTD_NextActions.org~ with a link to
the true next action itself.

*** ~GTD_ProjectList.org~

This is where projects go.  All projects are level 2 headlines of type
GTD-PROJECT allowing the use of level 1 headlined to divide by review frequency
required.  (Current Projects: review everyday, Less current projects: review
once a week ...)

*** ~GTD_SomedayMaybe.org~

A list of GTD-PROJECTs and GTD-SOMEDAY-MAYBEs that need a very low review
frequency.

*** ~GTD_Reference.org~

The place for non-actionnable things. Information that you don't want to forget
but that doesn't need its own notes file like the name of someone you met at a
thing.

When I mark something as GTD-REFERENCE, it can be to indicate to my future self
to file that here.  Say I complete an action like sending an e-mail and I want
to make sure that the person got it.  I can leave it in the actions list as
GTD-REFERENCE or GTD-WAITING depending on how much I care about the thing.  

*** ~wmd.org~

Not strictly part of GTD, but I use it a lot with GTD.  It stands for "What am I
doing" or if said fast "Wha m'I doing" or "wmd".

It has one headline "Current task" where I put what is the current task that I'm
on (because I often lose focus).  It has another headline "Candidates" which is
a select list of tasks.

When the day is over I delete the contents and refill the "Candidates" section
with candidate tasks for tomorrow.

It is important to reselect the tasks for tomorrow, not simply add to candidates
because "mind like water".

** Practices
*** Processing intray

Taking all the items from secondary capture tools like the notes app on your
phone and dumping them in the ~GTD_InTray.org~ and making everything a level 2
headline with type ~GTD-IN~.

For each ~GTD-IN~, clarify it and either
- do something about it and delete it,
- turn it into a GTD-ACTION and put it in ~GTD_NextActions.org~,
- turn it into a GTD-PROJECT and put it in ~GTD_ProjectList.org~ and maybe
  specify the outcome and next action,
- turn it into a GTD-SOMEDAY_MAYBE and put it in ~GTD_SomedayMaybe.org~,
- put it somewhere itn GTD-REFERENCE.

See the [[https://gettingthingsdone.com/pdfs/tt_workflow_chart.pdf][GTD flowchart]].

*** Review

Review each list of the system as often as you need to to get it's contents off
your mind.

Reviewing means looking at each project and action and making sure projects have
an outcome and next action.

It also means moving things around.  Project in your current projects that
turn into less current projects, less current projects that turn into current
projects.

The reviewing is what gets things off your mind, not the knowledge that your
reminders will pop at the right time.  There is much emphasis on "putting things
in a trusted system where you know that you'll see the right thing at the right
time".

This is *not* about finding the perfect reminder system that is so good that you
never have to look at anything.  The concept of project is too general for all
projects to be coverable by this sort of system.

It *is* all about review frequency.  The in tray works because when you put
something in there, in gets off your mind because you know that you'll come back
to it this evening when you empty your in tray.
*** Getting things done 

The GTD methodology gives *you* all the tools to have a clear mind and be able
to select what actions to do at any given time using your intuition and the four
criteria

- Context: I implement this using tags beginning by "at_" so at_house, at_apt,
  at_computer, at_poly.  So I'm at_poly and I have some time, I do a search and
  I get three tasks.  One is to print something, one is to buy something at the
  store, and one is to sign my teaching contract.  *People can also be contexts*
  because just as you need to be at_poly to buy the thing, you have tasks for
  which you need Fred to be there.  I will still write "at_fred" to make
  explicit that this is a context tag (I could have a document tagged "Fred"
  because it concerns Fred somehow).

- Energy available : I tag tasks with "easy" so that if I have time but I'm
  vedge, I can bring up some easy tasks.  Same thing if I'm feeling unproductive and I
  want to make myself feel better by marking a bunch of things as done.

- Time available : Marking the lengths of tasks can be useful in requesting only
  short tasks or long tasks to take advantage of the time landscape.

- Priority : Obviously more important tasks need to be done first.  I have a
  "priority actions" category in my ~GTD_NextActions.org~ file.

** Tools
*** Agenda and tags
Tags are used to search for actions any of the tags mentionned above but of
course, any other tags can be used and searched for.

We don't use agenda functionnalities.  Though we do set a ~org-agenda-files~ to
tell the tags search which files to search in.
*** Timestamps
Use the ~C-c .~ and
https://orgmode.org/manual/The-date_002ftime-prompt.html#The-date_002ftime-prompt
to insert dates and timestamps like a boss. And I'm thinking of looking into
ways of having the word "today " expand to "today [2018-09-11]" when you press
space after the "y" (like autocorrect on phones) and having other things for
similar words like "now " would expand to "now [2018-09-11 20:18]".
*** Perspective
I have a perspective file that has all by files in a nice layout which I call my
GTD dashboard.  Accessed with ~SPC a g d~.
*** Closing notes
I set org to ask me for closing notes (like asking for a commit message) when I
make something go from one of the red keywords to one of the green ones.

It's annoying when it is not pertinent but I have found it better to get a
little extra nudge to write something to close the task even if it bothers me
when I have to write closing notes for "Wish Sam a happy birthday".

If I want to bypass that I can also just manually type the "GTD-DONE".

The point is to strongly encourage closing notes on tasks.
*** capture templates
I have capture templates for some of the GTD objects.  I use these if something
pops into my head already clarified.

*NOTE* It is important to favor putting things in the In tray.  GTD's power to
 get things off your mind is based on the review.  Therefore the quality of the
 organized content is very important.

Speeding up the weekly review with our particular attention to how fast one can understand something. 
** Programmers are not necessarily organized ...

But we do have certain ways of doing things that can be very benificial to
people who are organized.

** Advantages

*** Consider very hard how much time it takes to understand something
We will attach great importance to changing a line of code that takes 2 seconds
to understand versus 10 seconds.  All a program is is layer upon layer of
gymnastics with data.  All you do at every layer is understand the gymnastics,
change them and repeat.

Understanding code is a central challenge and a major part of the activities of
programmers and developers.

The conventions, best practices, habits and values that have arisen are useful
in organizing ones personal data.

- Names
  - The importance of names
    I'll say things use a different word for this, the word you have could mean
    this or this.  When you read this next week, it will take you 2-3 seconds to
    figure out which one from the context.
  - The length of names
    We have long philosophical debates over the length things should have.  A
    longer name gives more information, a shorter name reads faster.  But there
    are many more considerations than these when it comes to names in computer
    science.
- Best practices
  - Short functions
- Habits
  - Always thinking about how to make things easier to understand for future you
- Values
  - Programmers attribute merit to the programmer who writes easy to understand
    code.

*** We are used to creating and imposing strict rules on ourselves
- Naming conventions
  We have certain types of things that we write like this SomeTypeOfThing and
  other things that we name like this some_type_of_thing and others
  someTypeOfThing (notice the first letter not capitalized), and some
  WE_WRITE_LIKE_THIS.

  *As an example*: the all capitals one is for containers that hold a value that
  will never change.  The fact that it is written like that helps the programmer
  quickly identify this when he reads code.
- Coding style
- We are used to using special keywords for special purposes 
- Prefixes Inventing prefixes for groups of keywords
- Markup: We will surround things with various symbols add meaning, like {}[]()
  and other tags like <a...> ... </a>
*** Distrusting ourselves
I prefix all my course material with the code of the course.  Even if I'm
creating a subdirectory of my main directory for that course.  If I'm sending
and receiving files with people, I might click on a file, it winds up in my
downloads folder or on my desktop and I have to click the 

*** Organizing content hirarchically

We understand that when a function becomes too long, it becomes hard to manage
intellectually.  So we split it up.

Most non-programmers have this intuition but programmers are /insanely/ more
diligent about this.

If I'm organizing lists or files, as soon as a list or folder starts containing
10 items or more, I start asking myself if I can't subdivide it.

It turns out that when you have 5 things, you can almost always find two things
in there that relate to each other more than they do to the other three.  In
that case, you can create a category for those and a category "others" for the
rest.

*** A strong desire to help your future self understand what your doing now

Programmers think very hard about how their future self will see what they are
doing now.  We do a lot of things to help our future self understand.  This is
mostly in how we name things.

**** Naming things
I've had badly named variables cause me headaches so many times that in my code,
I will just sit back and cross my arms until I have the right name for a
variable.

I have found that not only does this help your future self, but it also helps
your present self.

**** Leaving explanations

Programmers are always afraid that they won't understand what they were doing.
Or they don't want to re-solve the problem to understand the solution they're
looking at.  So they will leave comments about their code.

*** Using non-WYSIWYG tools

Non WYSIWYG tools are actually not that hard to use but it is such a foreign
concept to non-programmers that even if it were to be easy for them, they won't
go for it.

This deprives them of the most crucial organizing tool in existence: org-mode.

*** Comfort with code

The idea that the computer might do something with the words in your text or
the idea of writing text to make the computer do things is something that scares
or confuses the average user.

However, nothing is that hard about it but people are uncomfortable with that
idea.

** Mom

*** Hirarchical thinking

"Make this into it's own section".

I've helped her with her files, having her make subdirectories when hitting 5-7
items in any directory.

With Org-mode, making her try really hard to constantly be on the lookout for
opportunities to group things together into subsections.  Turning 5 sections
into two sections with 2 and three subsections respectively.

She started to like how it felt to have things organized this way and a couple
times, she was proud to say "look I took notes on the condo and notes on the
house and I made a section Notes on Realestate, and I made those two subsections
of that".

This is an extremely powerful idea.

*** Helping your future self

Just so many times going "Give this section a better title" and "there's no way
you'll understand that later".  Programmers are really good at this.

Often I've asked for explanations about the particular item we were filing and
added that to the item before filing it.

*** Non-WYSIWYG tools
Mom was able to grasp the concept and she's been able to write an email in
org-mode with the normal workflow
- Create new file and write stuff
- As long as the email is not to your liking, repeat this:
  - Export the file
  - Read the exported file
  - Edit the org-mode file
- Copy-paste into an email and send



*** Comfort with code

Given that she was able to write emails in org-mode, she's OK with the idea of
the computer interpreting certain symbols in text.

However, I haven't come around to the idea of showing her commands.

* Notes for Alex

Options:
- Rundown of the concepts so you can get started
- First steps so you can get started without knowing the rest
- Rundown of the process
- Tools and implementation.
- How it has changed things for me
- Comment about being scared to see a truly complete list of all your
  commitments and everything you have going on big and small.
** Criteria for deciding actions
*** Context
*** Energy available
** Inputs

** Other concepts
*** Projects and Actions
An *action* is something you can do all at once.  A *project* is anything you
want to do that takes *more than one action*.

Both of these *actions* and *projects* exist because you want to achieve a
certain *outcome*.  The outcomes for actions are usually evident "Call Mario for
his birthday" has the desired outcome of "I have called Mario for his birthday".

But when an item from In becomes a project, it should be assigned an outcome.
** From input to organized

*** Capture
  Putting things in a set of lists collectively referred to as In.

  In be a combination of more than one list.  It's where we put things to dump
  them out of our mind.
*** Clarify
  Turning "meeting Alex" into "Plan meeting with Alex".
*** Organize
  Putting the "Plan meeting with Alex" in the right place so that it pops in my
  face at the right time.
**** The 4 lists 
- Actions
- Projects
- References
- SomedayMaybe
**** Other
The book contains many tips that can be used to help.
*** Reflect
*Not there yet in my own implementation*.  This is where you make decisions
about what actions you are going to select.

The book gives some methodology that helps do this efficiently.  In essense it
is reviewing certain things at different frequencies.
*** Engage
This is the part where you do the actions.  *I'm not there yet either*.

** First steps

*** Setup capturing tools
- A designated file on your phone
- A designated text file on your computer
- ...

*** Capture things

** Org-mode
I think the power it gives for organizing thoughts, projects, ideas and
information is worth putting up with the quirks of emacs.

These are
- You have to press CTRL-X CTRL-S to save.
- Emacs makes a distinction between an open file (that it calls a buffer) and
  the actual file on disk (which it calls a file).  Therefore the names of some
  commands may sound weird.
- CTRL-Anything does something.  So it's easy to make emacs do something by
  mistake.

To mitigate this there is
- Remembering some of the keys
- Using a package called ergoemacs that sets many of the familiar OS shortcuts
  like CTRL-C and CTRL-V to their usual behavior
- Knowing about buffers and files makes this problem disappear.

* Ideas
** Idea : Have a LAST_TIME_CURATED property to certain todo lists
 Also a NEXT_CURATE property that I could set so my curating routine would be
 selecting all the items for the NEXT_CURATE is passed.

 On each item, I curate the item, then mark the LAST_CURATED, then select a
 NEXT_CURATE.

* Notes about getting things done

** Notes from the book

*** The three key objectives

1. *Capturing*
   Capturing anything that needs to get done, or intests me or has usefulness.
2. *Directing*
   Making decisions about inputs to have an inventory of next actions that you cna
   implement or renegotiate in the moment.
3. *Curating and coordinating*

* Quotes and passages

** Passages
   
*** to be confident that what you're doing right now is what you need to be doing
 * Quoted from memory, possibly not the exact wording
*** An ambient angst pervades our society
 --there'sa sense that somehow there's something we should be doing that we're
 not, which creates a tension for which there is no resolution and from which
 there is no rest.

*** It's possible for a person to have an overwhelming number of things to do and...
function productifely with a clear head and a positive sense of relaxed control.
That's a great way to live and work, at elevated levels of effectiveness and
efficiency.  It's also the best way to be fully present with whatever you're
doing, appropriately engaged in the momemnt.  It's when time disappears and your
attention is completely at your command.  What you're doing is exactly what you
ought to be doing, given the whole spectrum of your commitments and interests.
You're fully available.  You're "on".
*** A paradox has emerged in this new millenium: people have enhanced quality of life,
but at the same time they are adding to their stress levels by taking on more
than they have the resources to handle. [...] The plethora of options and
opportunities brings with it the pressures of decision making and choices.

** Quotes

*** "As to methods" Ralph Waldo Emmerson
As to methods there may be a million and then some, but the principles are few.
The man who grasps principles can successfully select his own methods.  The man
who tries methods, ignoring principles, is sure to have trouble.
*** "Anxiety is caused by" David Kekich
Anxiety is caused by a lack of control, organization, preparation, and action.
*** "There is one thing we can do," Mark Van Doren
and the happiest people are those who can do it to the limit of their ability.
We can be completely present. We can be all here. We can give ... our attention
to the opportunity before us.
