** List of notes files

*** [[file:notes_ideas.org][(=Notes_ideas.org=) Ideas]]
Random ideas
*** [[file:todos.org][(=todos.org=) Main Todo List]]
Main TODO list. The intention is that this would be a place where I can dump my
TODO's
*** [[file:wmd.org][(=wmd.org=) Wha'm I Doing]] 
When I realize that I've been on a side-quest and try to remember what I was
doing, I ask myself "wha'm I doing".

This file is meant to be open in a prominent way so that I can remember what is
the task at hand.  I don't want to look up an SQL command and wind up spending
three hours learning everything there is to know about B-Trees.
