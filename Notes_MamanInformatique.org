** The locations of things

*** Understanding file-data and file-abstraction

- *File-data* Is actual bytes on disc.  We can't see a file.

- *File-abstraction* An illusion that the computer creates to for us to use as a
 means of communication.

 Consider a library of 5 min long VHS cassetes. The disc is an actual book-case
 filled with cassettes. And those cassetes form movies. The files on the
 computer are like sheets of paper that say

 |   Movie | The Mask |
 |---------+----------|
 |---------+----------|
 | minutes | cassette |
 |---------+----------|
 |         | 0x134757 |
 |     5-9 | 0x903947 |
 |   10-14 | 0x103176 |

 Those /file-abstractions/ are what's organised in a directory structure and the
 /file-data/ is in those cassetes.

*** Moving files moves the paper, not the data (WHEN POSSIBLE)

Moving files from one place to another on the *same drive* Only changes
/file-abstractions/, the /file data/ stays where it is.

Each bookcase full of VHS tapes is like a hard-drive, it has it's own file
cabinet with the file-abstractions.  If you want to move something from one disc
to another, then the file-abstraction and the file-data need to be copied.

That's why moving a file can take a long time or a short time.

When we understand that by moving a file-icon, we are not moving the file but
rather giving instructions, it becomes easier to understand why similar requests
are carried out in different ways.


*** Directories

Directories are just pieces of paper that have references to files on them.

We *interpret* this as the directory structure.

*** Trees (Naturally!)

The relation of containment naturally lends itself to the concept of a tree.

**** TODO Draw an abbreviated version of the filesystem tree
     :PROPERTIES:
     :ID:       D77BBEB1-FE54-4ADA-9FAA-E734AB7D768D
     :END:

**** TODO A quick word on paths
     :PROPERTIES:
     :ID:       245D8E75-36F3-45C6-A8FB-48DF55EFBE0B
     :END:

You don't need to know paths, and you will never have to use them but it will
being exposed to this idea and forgetting about it right after will leave you
with a better understanding of what files are.


* Words

*** Bits, bytes
 Units of memory. Although a bit is the smallest unit of information, memory is
 measured in bytes which just means a chunk of 8 bits.
 k
*** Files
 A pair containing file-data and an associated file-abstraction.
*** File-data
 This designates the actual data of a file
*** File-abstraction
 This is what the user sees.  It is a construct presented to the user in order
 for them to manipulate files.
*** Tree
 A tree is a thing that has a list of trees;  Seems illogical but consider that a
 directory is just a thing that contains directories.
*** Parent directory
 This is an attribute of a file-abstraction, it means the directory that contains
 the file.
*** Child, children
 This is an attribute of a directory, it is the list of files that this directory
 contains but non recursively.
